## Hosting Projects with ISYE

Many projects in our lab have online demos that we want permanently hosted. ISYE has a virtual machine (VM) set up to host these projects for us. The VM has a script that regularly pulls from GitHub repositories ("repos") under ISYE'S GT GitHub organization (https://github.gatech.edu/isye-web).

To host a project with ISYE, you need:

1. Your project code on a repo on one of the CEC GitHubs (github.com/gt-cec or github.gatech.edu/cec).

2. A server in your codebase. If you only need to host static HTML/CSS/JS files, ISYE has an Apache server that can do that.

3. A GitHub repo with ISYE for the project. 

4. A subdomain that ISYE will link to your project in the VM.

5. A GitHub Action to automatically sync your code on the CEC GitHub (github.com/gt-cec) with the repo on the ISYE GitHub (github.gatech.edu/isye-web). 

This document details how to do steps 2-5. It is assumed that you have been using Git and GitHub for your project.

As of April 21, 2024, here is the status of the ISYE-hosted projects:

### Setting up your project for deployment

The goal of this section is to set up your codebase so ISYE knows what external packages to install, 

**The first thing to do is remove all API keys, usernames/passwords, and user data from your codebase.** API keys, username, and passwords should always be [environment variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-an-environment-variable-in-linux/). For IRB purposes, user data should never be on GitHub, which you can ensure by [making a `.gitignore` file that excludes the log files](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_ignore.asp?remote=github). If you have already added sensitive info to GitHub, you can [squash your repository](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9254257) so people cannot go through the commit history and retrieve it.

Once your codebase and GitHub repository are clean from things that could get you an angry email from the IRB, you can proceed.

Most of our projects use flask (Python) or JATOS (Java). Our projects typically require two sets of dependencies: system dependencies (`apt-get install XXX`) and language-specific libraries (`pip install XXX`).

ISYE's VM runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). RHEL is Debian-based, like Ubuntu, so for most purposes they are identical. Ubuntu's package manager is called `apt`, while RHEL's is called `yum`.

Most `apt` packages have an equivalent on `yum`, or have a downloadable `.rpm` package that can be installed with `yum`. Some libraries advertise support for CentOS, which is an open source version of RHEL and is probably compatible.

For our projects to run on the VM, we need to include three files at the top level of our project.

1. `yum-requirements.txt` is a simple list of `yum` packages to install, for example:

```
python3.9
openjdk11
Tesseract 5, from https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
```

Only include packages that are strictly required for your server to run. Most of the usual packages (Python, Java) will already be installed by the VM. For example, at the time of writing OpenCV is not compatible with Python 3.10+, so I would specify python3.9 here.

If a package is not available on `yum` and there is a Linux version available, just include a link to the package's website, like I did for Tesseract.

This text file is not run automatically â€” the ISYE staff install the packages manually. It just helps to have all the `yum` dependencies in one place so they (and our future labmates) know what to install.

2. `pip-requirements.txt` is a simple list of `pip` packages to install, for example:

```
matplotlib
opencv
flask
pygame
numpy==1.0.2
```

Note how I specified a NumPy version. You can follow that format for any version-specific packages. Packages without a version specified will use their latest version.

The `pip` requirements are installed automatically from this text file.

If you are not using `pip` or Python, this file can be ignored. Email the ISYE helpdesk if you need anything else installed.

3. `run.sh` is a bash script that the VM will run to start the webserver, for example:

```
python webserver.py
```

You can test this bash file on your local machine.

We use this `run.sh` file so that launching is standardized across all projects, and so that you can set up environment variables or command line arguments if you would like. For example, if I set up my webserver to take in a `demo=` parameter to decide whether to skip the consent form, my `run.sh` could look like:

```
python webserver.py demo=true
```

It is common to use environment variables to indicate which port the server should listen on. I strongly recommend doing this because ISYE will give you a port to use for your server. To set the `PORT` environment variable, for example:

```
export PORT=567
python webserver.py
```

In `webserver.py`, the variable can be accessed by:

```
port = int(os.getenv("PORT", default=80))  # gets the PORT env var, or defaults to 80
```

Remember that the `run.sh` script does not have `sudo` access! You should not need sudo access for anything, and if you do, restructure your project so you do not.


### Getting an ISYE GitHub repo

The 



If your project does not already have an ISYE repo, email `helpdesk@isye.gatech.edu` and ask for a repo on the isye-web organization.

That means we need to sync our project's code to the corresponding repository
